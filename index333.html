                    <p> 
                        Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).
                         Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.
                          The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return.
                         The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.
                    </p>
                    <P> 
                        Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users.
                         The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis.
                        It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis.
                         During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term tennis referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis.
                        The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times,
                         and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system,
                          which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.
                        Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport.
                         The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts,
                          the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open also played on hard courts.

                        Tennis is great fun and is accessible to all ages and skill levels. But there are other benefits to picking up a racket and playing
                        As well as serving up plenty of smiles, tennis is good for your physical and mental health. It can help lower body fat while improving muscle toning, strength and flexibility.
                        It can even help you to live longer.
                        In terms of mental health, exercise is hugely important in maintaining a good state of mind. Playing a game of tennis will release those happy endorphins to help you feel great!
                        It is also a fantastic way to spend some time with family and friends and will provide you with the opportunity to meet new people.

                                    Djokovic’s victory over Federer in the 2014 Wimbledon final made him – not Rafael Nadal – the first<br>
                                     man to defeat Federer at all four Grand Slams. Djokovic had also eclipsed what appeared to be<br>
                                      a fading Nadal as the player with the best chance to beat Federer’s major record,<br>

                                    He is the only player to have twice won the Grand Slam, doing it once as an amateur in 1962 and<br>
                                    again as a pro in 1969. If Laver was not excluded from the Grand Slam tournaments during a <br>
                                    five-year period in the mid-1960s, who knows how many he would have won. During this time period,<br>
                                    the pre-open era, the Grand Slam tournaments were for amateurs only. The “open era” in tennis<br>
                                    did not begin until 1968, when professionals were finally allowed to compete in the Grand Slam<br>
                                    events. Given that Laver was ranked number one in the world during this five-year period,<br>
                                    it’s likely he would have won many more Grand Slam titles.

                                    Pete's place in tennis history is difficult to judge as he only won three of the four Grand Slam<br>
                                    events over the course of his career. Clearly more comfortable on hard courts and grass how do we<br>
                                    decide one's place when they dominate on one surface and struggle on another. When Pete retired in 2002,<br>
                                    he was considered to be the best player of all-time although some would dispute this.<br>
                                    He was number one in the world rankings for six consecutive years and his 14 Grand Slam titles was<br>
                                    a record at the time. Who can forget his epic battles with Andre Agassi that made the 1990s a great <br>
                                    decade for tennis? Pete went out on top when he won the 2002 US Open, his last Grand Slam tournament.<br>
                                    But, without a French Open title, or even a final, how do we decide where he belongs in the list of best<br>
                                    ever. For now I think he comes in at the number five spot.
