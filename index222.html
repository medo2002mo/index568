            <p> 
                Football has been recognized as one of the most popular games across the globe.
                Almost every country in the world has its set of football teams and enthusiastic football fans.
                Several football tournaments are held each year at national and international level.
                The popularity of this game can very well be judged by the excitement that builds among the general public during these matches.
                It is said that the game of football was invented by England in the mid 19th century. However, the Chinese claim that it was invented by them.
                The International Football Association Board has set the rule of the football game to maintain uniformity and 
                carry out the international tournaments smoothly.
                Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) organizes Football World Cup every four years.
                 Football teams from various countries participate in the world cup. This is one of the biggest sports events worldwide and 
                 is awaited eagerly by football fans.
            </p>

                Football is a game that involves kicking of ball with the feet to make a goal.
                 Two teams comprising of eleven players each compete against each other to emerge winner in this game. 
                 It is played at international level by teams belonging to various countries.
                 Unlike other sports, the football teams of various counties have been given unique names by which they are popular among the football fans.

                        UEFA Champions League came about as a new version of the European Cup and was played for the first time in the 1992-1993 season.
                        Already established as the most prestigious club tournament in football,
                        Champions League has become even more popular with the introduction of a mini-league group stage system.
                        The new concept had a resemblance to the FIFA World Cup with an early phase of group play followed by a knockout phase.
                        On several occasions has the competition expanded to include more clubs – the initial 8 have become 32 (qualification stage excluded). 
                        The Champions League trophy can be kept permanently by a club that win the tournament five times or three times in a row
                        (since the rule changed in 2008 it is only a replica).
                        It is today almost as adored as the FIFA World Cup Trophy.

                         the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930,

                    <p> 
                        Salah started his senior career with Egyptian club Al Mokawloon, departing shortly thereafter to join Swiss side Basel for an undisclosed fee. In Switzerland,
                        his performances attracted Premier League side Chelsea, who signed him in 2014 for a reported fee of £11 million. However,
                        he was used sparingly in his debut season and was allowed to leave on loan to Serie A clubs Fiorentina and Roma, 
                        with the latter eventually signing him permanently for €15 million. Following his role in helping Roma to a second-placed finish and a club record points-tally in 2017,
                        Salah returned to the Premier League to sign for Liverpool for a then club-record fee of £36.9 million.
                        In his second spell in England, Salah adapted his game from a natural winger to a forward, and he netted 32 goals in 36 league games in his debut season,
                        winning the Premier League Golden Boot and breaking the Premier League scoring record for a 38-game season. Salah's performances earned him a number of individual accolades,
                        including the PFA Players' Player of the Year. He also came third in the 2018 Best FIFA Men's Player award. The following season, 
                        he finished as the Premier League's joint-top goalscorer and helped Liverpool win the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League, scoring in the final.
                        In his third season at the club, he helped the team win the 2019–20 Premier League, which ended the club's 30-year league title drought.

                        Diego Maradona, in full Diego Armando Maradona, (born October 30, 1960, Lanus, Buenos Aires,
                        Argentina—died November 25, 2020, Tigre, Buenos Aires), Argentine football (soccer) player who
                        is generally regarded as the top footballer of the 1980s and one of the greatest of all time.
                        Renowned for his ability to control the ball and create scoring opportunities for himself and others,
                        he led club teams to championships in
                        Argentina, Italy, and Spain, and he starred on the Argentine national team that won the 1986 World Cup.
                        Maradona displayed football talent early, and at age eight he joined Las Cebollitas (“The Little Onions”),
                        a boys’ team that went on to win 136 consecutive games and a national championship.
                        He signed with Argentinos Juniors at age 14 and made his first-division debut in 1976, 10 days before his 16th birthday.
                        Only four months later he made his debut with the national team, becoming the youngest Argentine ever to do so.
                        Although he was excluded from the 1978 World Cup-winning squad because it was felt that he was still too young,
                        the next year he led the national under-20 team to a Junior World Cup championship.

                    <p> 
                        Brazilian soccer star Ronaldinho came from a family of soccer players to reach the pinnacle of success in the sport.
                         After a celebrated youth career, Ronaldinho became a key member of the Brazilian team that won the 2002 World Cup.
                         He has played for clubs in Brazil, France, Spain and Italy,
                         and has twice been named FIFA World Player of the Year.
                         best known for his years at Spanish football club FC Barcelona. He became a naturalized Spanish citizen in January 2007
                      . Ronaldinho, meaning "little Ronaldo", is better known in Brazil by the nickname Ronaldinho Gaúcho, in order to distinguish him from Ronaldo (already called Ronaldinho in Brazil).
                       However, upon Ronaldo's move to Europe, he began to be known simply as 'Ronaldo', thereby allowing Ronaldinho to drop Gaúcho and remain simply as 'Ronaldinho'.
                        Among his many achievements and accolades, Ronaldinho has been awarded the FIFA World Player of the Year award twice (2004, 2005), as well as the European Footballer of 
                       the Year award and the FIFPro World Player of the Year award twice (2005, 2006). He has downplayed suggestions that he is the best footballer in the world, telling FourFourTwo magazine, 
                       "I don't even feel I'm the best at Barça."
                       Currently, he plays for FC Barcelona with a contract ending in 2010.

                <p> 
                    Founded on 6 March 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since inception. The word real is Spanish for "royal" 
                    and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu 
                    Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history.
                    The club was estimated to be worth €3.8 billion ($4.2 billion) in 2019, and it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €757.3 million in 2019.
                    The club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world. Real Madrid is one of three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since
                     its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona. The club holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid.
